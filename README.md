# Purpose

Just incase something happens to my computer I'll at least have some of the notes from my classes. Also trying to get more comfottable with GitHub and how this whole thing works. Some usefull code as well. 

NOTE: These are in no way totally comprehesive as most of my studying is done on paper.

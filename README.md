# Purpose

A place to get more comfottable with GitHub and also... 
    1. Just incase something happens to my computer I'll at least have some of the notes from my classes. 
    2. also a workspace for some random leetcode problems.
    3. and a place to code other new random things related to school.
    4. or other random notes. 

NOTE: These are in no way totally comprehesive as most of my studying is done on paper.
